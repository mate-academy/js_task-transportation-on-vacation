# Task

After a hard quarter in ecide to get some rest
on a vacation. So you will book a flight for you and your family
and try to leave all the mess behind you.

You will need a rental car in order for you to get around in your
vacation. The manager of the car rental makes you some good offers.

Every day you rent the car costs $40. If you rent the car for 7 or
more days, you get $50 off your total. Alternatively, if you rent
the car for 3 or more days, you get $20 off your total.

Implement `calculateRentalCost` function which returns the total
amount for different count of `days`.

Examples: 
- `calculateRentalCost(1) === 40`
- `calculateRentalCost(3) === 100`
- `calculateRentalCost(7) === 230`
