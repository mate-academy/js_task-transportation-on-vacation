# Transportation on Vacation

## Task description:

After a hard quarter in the office you decide to get some rest on a vacation. So you
will book a flight for you and your family and try to leave all the mess behind you.

You will need a rental car in order for you to get around in your vacation. The
manager of the car rental makes you some good offers.

Every day you rent the car costs `$40`. If you rent the car for `7` or more days, you
get `$50` off your total. Alternatively, if you rent the car for `3` or more days,you
get `$20` off your total.

Implement `calculateRentalCost` function that returns the total amount for different
number of days.

Examples:
```js
calculateRentalCost(1); // 40
calculateRentalCost(3); // 100
calculateRentalCost(7); // 230
```
