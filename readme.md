# Task

After a hard quarter in the office you decide to get some rest
on a vacation. So you will book a flight for you and your family
and try to leave all the mess behind you.

You will need a rental car in order for you to get around in your
vacation. The manager of the car rental makes you some good offers.


Examples: 
- `calculateRentalCost(1) === 40`
- `calculateRentalCost(3) === 100`
- `calculateRentalCost(7) === 230`
